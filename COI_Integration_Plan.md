# Child Opportunity Index (COI) Integration Plan

## üéØ Overview

This document outlines the plan to integrate Child Opportunity Index (COI) data into our existing ADI + Distance analysis, creating a comprehensive neighborhood assessment tool that measures both **adult disadvantage** (ADI) and **child opportunity** (COI).

### What is COI?
The Child Opportunity Index measures neighborhood conditions that matter for child development across **three major domains**:
- **Education**: Quality of early childhood, elementary, and secondary education
- **Health & Environment**: Environmental quality, health resources, and safety
- **Social & Economic**: Economic resources, employment, housing, and wealth

### COI + ADI: Perfect Complement
- **ADI**: Measures adult socioeconomic disadvantage (healthcare/research focus)
- **COI**: Measures child development opportunities (family/policy focus)
- **Together**: Comprehensive neighborhood assessment for family-focused research

## üìä Recommended COI Metrics for Integration

Based on analysis of 137+ available COI variables, here are the **most valuable metrics** for research:

### Tier 1: Essential COI Metrics (8 variables)
**Overall Index:**
1. `r_COI_nat` - Child Opportunity Score (National, 1-100)
2. `c5_COI_nat` - Child Opportunity Level (Very Low to Very High)

**Main Domain Scores:**
3. `r_ED_nat` - Education Score (National, 1-100)
4. `r_HE_nat` - Health & Environment Score (National, 1-100) 
5. `r_SE_nat` - Social & Economic Score (National, 1-100)

**Main Domain Levels:**
6. `c5_ED_nat` - Education Level (Very Low to Very High)
7. `c5_HE_nat` - Health & Environment Level (Very Low to Very High)
8. `c5_SE_nat` - Social & Economic Level (Very Low to Very High)

### Tier 2: Key Subdomain Metrics (Optional 6 variables)
**Education Subdomains:**
9. `r_ED_EL_nat` - Elementary Education Score (1-100)
10. `r_ED_ER_nat` - Educational Resources Score (1-100)

**Health & Environment Subdomains:**
11. `r_HE_HR_nat` - Health Resources Score (1-100)
12. `r_HE_HE_nat` - Healthy Environments Score (1-100)

**Social & Economic Subdomains:**
13. `r_SE_ER_nat` - Economic Resources Score (1-100)
14. `r_SE_HQ_nat` - Housing Quality Score (1-100)

### Rationale for Selection:
‚úÖ **Nationally normed** (comparable across all US locations)
‚úÖ **2020 data** (most recent and relevant)
‚úÖ **Research-proven domains** (established in child development literature)
‚úÖ **Interpretable scales** (1-100 scores + categorical levels)
‚úÖ **Policy-relevant** (actionable for intervention research)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Geographic Level Challenge
- **COI Data**: Census tract level (11-digit FIPS)
- **ADI Data**: Block group level (12-digit FIPS) 
- **Solution**: Map block groups to parent census tracts

### FIPS Code Mapping Strategy
```python
# Convert 12-digit block group FIPS to 11-digit tract FIPS
def blockgroup_to_tract_fips(bg_fips):
    """Convert block group FIPS (12 digits) to tract FIPS (11 digits)"""
    if len(str(bg_fips)) == 12:
        return str(bg_fips)[:11]  # Remove last digit (block group)
    return str(bg_fips)
```

### Code Integration Points

#### 1. Data Loading (Both Scripts)
```python
# Load COI data
COI_LOOKUP_CSV_PATH = os.path.join(project_root, "data", "reference", "COI", "1_index", "1_index.csv")
coi_df = pd.read_csv(COI_LOOKUP_CSV_PATH)
coi_df = coi_df[coi_df['year'] == 2020]  # Use most recent data
coi_df['tract_fips'] = coi_df['geoid20'].astype(str)
coi_lookup_dict = coi_df.set_index('tract_fips').to_dict('index')
```

#### 2. COI Lookup Function
```python
def lookup_coi_metrics(fips_code):
    """Lookup COI metrics from block group FIPS code"""
    if not fips_code:
        return [None] * 8  # Return None for all COI fields
    
    # Convert block group FIPS to tract FIPS
    tract_fips = blockgroup_to_tract_fips(fips_code)
    
    if tract_fips in coi_lookup_dict:
        coi_data = coi_lookup_dict[tract_fips]
        return [
            coi_data.get('r_COI_nat'),
            coi_data.get('c5_COI_nat'),
            coi_data.get('r_ED_nat'),
            coi_data.get('r_HE_nat'),
            coi_data.get('r_SE_nat'),
            coi_data.get('c5_ED_nat'),
            coi_data.get('c5_HE_nat'),
            coi_data.get('c5_SE_nat')
        ]
    return [None] * 8
```

#### 3. Excel Output with Multi-Sheet Structure
```python
# Create Excel writer with multiple sheets
with pd.ExcelWriter(OUTPUT_EXCEL_FILE_PATH, engine='openpyxl') as writer:
    # Sheet 1: Main results
    data_df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Results', index=False)
    
    # Sheet 2: Data dictionary
    data_dict_df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Data Dictionary', index=False)
```
