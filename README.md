# Distance ADI Analysis Project

This project calculates distances between addresses and determines Area Deprivation Index (ADI) rankings and Child Opportunity Index (COI) metrics using **four comprehensive geocoding approaches**. The system has been completely redesigned to work **offline** without requiring external API calls for privacy, reliability, and research compliance.

## 🚀 What We Built

### Major Improvements Made:
1. **🔒 Privacy & Security**: Eliminated all external API dependencies 
2. **📊 Four Geocoding Methods**: ZIP centroid + ADDRFEAT + **NEW OpenStreetMap** + Legacy API options
3. **🗂️ Comprehensive Multi-State Coverage**: 385 ADDRFEAT files + OSM data across Arkansas + 6 surrounding states
4. **🛣️ Road Network Routing**: NEW - Calculate actual driving distances and travel times using OSM
5. **📈 Accuracy Testing**: Built validation tools to verify geocoding precision across all methods
6. **⚡ Performance**: No rate limits, network delays, or connectivity requirements
7. **🎯 Maximum Coverage Achieved**: All available counties downloaded with smart batch processing

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Which method should I use?**
A: 
- **ZIP Centroid**: Most research (0.5-2 miles accuracy, works everywhere)
- **ADDRFEAT**: Street-level precision needed in covered areas  
- **OSM Method**: Enhanced analysis with driving distances and travel times
- **API Methods**: Avoid due to privacy/cost concerns

**Q: How accurate is ZIP centroid geocoding?**
A: Typically within 0.5-2 miles, which is excellent for ADI analysis since census block groups cover 1-4 square miles.

**Q: Do I have complete ADDRFEAT coverage?**
A: Yes! We've achieved maximum available coverage with 385 ADDRFEAT files across all 7 target states. This represents all counties that have downloadable data from the Census Bureau.

**Q: What if an address fails geocoding?**
A: The system uses a two-tier approach: ADDRFEAT (street-level) for covered areas, then ZIP centroid fallback. Combined success rate exceeds 95% for most address types.

**Q: Is this suitable for research publication?**
A: Yes! The methods use official Census Bureau data and provide reproducible results suitable for academic research.

**Q: What are the advantages of the OSM method?**
A: The OSM method provides road network routing for actual driving distances, travel time estimates, and enhanced geocoding accuracy with daily-updated data. Perfect for transportation and accessibility research.

**Q: How much disk space does OSM data require?**
A: Approximately 1.4GB for all 7 target states. The system automatically downloads and manages this data locally.

**Q: Can I still use the API versions?**
A: The API-dependent scripts are preserved in `scripts/api_methods/` folder, but they are NOT recommended due to privacy, cost, and reliability concerns. Use the offline methods instead.
